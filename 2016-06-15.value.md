# The True Value of Software Developers

Technology is an ever present factor of human civilisation. It forms the basis of almost every industry in the developed world. Consequentially, the demand for people who understand and create technology continues to grow. In steps 'The Developer', an artist who can create order from chaos using nothing but ideas and time. 

Fred Brooks wrote in [Mythical Man Month](http://people.apache.org/~acmurthy/WhyIsProgrammingFun.html): "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures."

Creating new and improving old is good business. Or is it? 

## Business Ideals

"Good business" is most commonly measured in small timescales: monthly, quarterly, and annually (at a stretch). This can often cause organisations to think in the short term. 

Scenario:
    
    Your organisation sells a particular product but sales of that product have been steadily decreasing over the past few quarters. It is up to you to come up with a strategy to improve this situation.

Naturally, you are going to try to find a quick fix to boost those sales. A new advertising campaign perhaps? A short sharp burst of spending on brand awareness that will surely boost sales for next quarter. It works! You made more money in a small amount of time. Good business, well done.

This way of thinking may mark you as the genius who doubles sales with an ad campaign, but does it really enhance the organisation?

## Development Ideals

Developing software is an entirely different beast. It is very difficult to apply this "Good business" principle to software development, especially if the product is not the software itself.

Using the scenario above, Let's break it down. 

Instead of splashing some cash out for short term gains, how would you improve your current way of working so that it is more efficient? Lets say your organisation uses software which manages internal inventory, shipping, ordering and stock. How efficient is it? What if it isn't? Let's put some money and effort into developing a more efficient alternative. 

But wait, what if it takes a long time? That's not good business. That's true... under traditional business ideals, it isn't good business. The problem here is that there is no direct, tangible correlation between spending money on development, and getting results within the next quarter.

However, lets say that the new software is developed and released several quarters later. Instantly, it is made clear that the increased efficiency provided by the new software means that less man power needs to be spent on management of inventory, shipping, ordering and stock. The employees operating this can be re-purposed and assigned to new roles, production can be ramped up at no extra cost, or maybe temporary staff which no longer need to be paid for can be laid off (this leads to the very real issue of labour automation, a story for another day). The software has added value to the organisation. 

If your organisation grows and sales increase, you can be safe in the knowledge that more money doesn't need to be spent on hiring temporary staff to deal with increasing demand in inventory, since the software can deal with the load.

In short (because short is apparently good business!), investing in software development instead of short term solutions is an investment in the future. A smart decision, based on the knowledge that it will have a positive impact indefinitely, not just in the short term. It may not seem to pay off in the next few quarters, but it might just ensure the organisation doesn't boom and bust.

## Software Development as a Profession

It's worth noting that software development as a profession is still in its infancy. Organisations know that investment in IT and development is important, they just don't seem to know how or why when the balance sheet in front of them is telling them otherwise. 

Traditional professions are structured hierarchically. You start off as a post man, working for your supervisor who is managed by the depot manager who is managed by the area manager who is managed by the national manager etc. The software profession is different because there is very little hierarchy like this, and in my opinion there shouldn't be. There is a lot more fluidity and collaboration between the people running the show and the newbies who would be doing the post man job. (Obviously there are different roles. For example the project manager will be far less development focused and more people focused. But in well performing software companies there are not many more levels to the hierarchical tree than that)

Little is understood about how this fluidity can be translated into the strict hierarchies that exist in industries of old, and those projects which attempt to structure them as such are destined to cost far too much or fail altogether. The rise of agile development has enabled traditional business-types to see incremental progress as development teams pursue long term goals, as long as it's implemented correctly. This has been a step towards more integration between business and development.

But what needs to be understood most is that developers are problem solvers. Bring us problems, let us work on them for a while and give you something to use to alleviate those problems. This is where the true value of a developer can be found. 

## LTSE - Long Term Stock Exchange

Eric Ries, author of The Lean Startup, has laid out his plans to create the LTSE, a long term exchange that solves the problem of short term thinking in public markets. He has said that public markets encourage self-destructive behaviour, based on metrics which only account for short term results.

The idea behind it is that executive pay for listed companies is not linked to their short-term stock performance, which in tern will discourage short-term gain practices in pursuit of bonuses. This is just one of many rules which the LTSE will be governed by to try to bolster the long term thinking of its participants.

## Conclusion

This post has sort of gone off on a tangent from what I had intended to write but all of the points I make are valid. I think the value of good developers is mostly underestimated in most parts of the world where traditional business practices and hierarchies are prevalent. There is a revolution going on in Silicon Valley where the sort of thinking by successful entrepreneurs such as Eric Ries are standing up for more development focused ideals, and I'm looking forward to more emphasis being placed on development around the world.

Build an organisation on a strong backbone of development ideals, continuous improvement and innovation; and the organisation will not only flourish, but sustain itself and hopefully be a force for good in this world. 

The true value of developers? Developers are invaluable.
