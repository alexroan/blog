# Opinions on Kickoff.ai

I'm an avid fan and player of team sports. Whether it's football, rugby, american football, etc. I can't get enough. 

Throughout June and early July, the footballing world saw the latest European championships take place. For me, seeing the Welsh team progress all the way to the semi-finals felt like a dream that I never wanted to wake up from. But what was the likelihood of something like that happening? In fact, how likely is any result of any football match?

Predicting the results of sports matches is notoriously difficult, especially for a sport like football. Other sports, not so much. In Rugby, the team with more possession and territory are very highly likely to win. One off chance by the weaker team will likely only equal one try, but many chances by the dominant team will likely mean many tries. In football however, the dominant team may have all the possession and territory, but fail to find the net, where the weaker team have one chance and make it count (much like Wales did in the Euros). This is what makes football predictions so difficult.

Traditionally, betting predictions on team sports are evaluated by a number of things such as team trends, weather and home advantage. However, before the tournament began, I saw a link on HN to a new football result prediction site called [Kickoff.ai](Kickoff.ai) which claimed to use a completely different method of making predictions.

Instead of using the traditional data points for predictions, mainly based on treating each team as its own entity, Kickoff.ai rates each player using a "Kickscore", and then uses the accumulation of Kickscores on a team to assess the likelihood of a win. 

>"The Kickscore is computed based on the outcomes of matches in which the player participated. It can be approximately understood as follows: if the sum of the Kickscores of a team's players is high, the team is expected to perform well. Although the actual prediction is significantly more complex, the Kickscore measures the players' contribution to a team's success."

(This Kickscore calculation is based on the results in which the players were playing in International, European club, and large domestic league matches. At the time of the Euro 2016 Championships there were some players which hadn't played in any large domestic or European club league such as Chris Gunter, who played for Reading in the second tier of English football. These players will likely have Kickscores relating only to the Euro 2016 Qualifying matches and International friendlies.)

As well as this, they use Bayesian inference, which is a calculation to predict the confidence of any given outcome prediction. 

## Criticisms

When the article first appeared on HN, there was much discussion about their approach to the problem. I noticed a few things that could maybe be throwing the model off slightly, namely:

- Friendly matches are taken into account when calculating Kickscore. This could be misleading since many friendly games are often more about building fitness than obtaining a positive result.
- Weather affects results. More wind and rain = less goals in a game
- Are substitutions taken into account?
- During the group stage of the Euros, a team may have already won two games, meaning their passage to the knockout stages in assured. They could then rest some players for the last group game, skewing the result.
- Not all leagues are taken into account (as expressed earlier with Chris Gunter)

Others also noted the lack of handling of possible draws in results. I got a response from the original poster, and the post and response can be seen [here](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11869575).

## Performance

They currently have an evaluation of their performance on their [home page](http://kickoff.ai/). It shows the accuracy if their prediction being better than that of betting odds, but with drawn matches discarded since they were not dealt with by the model. This looks to be a promising start for the model, which as has been pointed out has some inefficiencies.

All things considered, I like this approach very much. Obviously there are many things in which can be taken into account and adjusted, this looks like it could be the future of sporting predictions. In my view, a combination of both the old team based metrics and trends, mixed with this new ethos of treating a team as the sum of its parts could be the most potent mix for promising predictions.
