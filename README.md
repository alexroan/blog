# Alex Roan's Blog

This is a compilation of blog posts which used to reside on a private server which ran [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). However I have freed that space up for other side projects, hence the move to Github. (Newest First:)

### [Making Old Private Projects Public](https://github.com/alexroan/blog/blob/master/2016-10-28.privaterepos.md)
### [Opinions on Kickoff.ai](https://github.com/alexroan/blog/blob/master/2016-08-18.kickoff.md)
### [Web Scraping](https://github.com/alexroan/blog/blob/master/2016-07-20.scraping.md)
### [The True Value of Software Developers](https://github.com/alexroan/blog/blob/master/2016-06-15.value.md)
### [OlympAIcs](https://github.com/alexroan/blog/blob/master/2016-05-25.olympaics.md)
### [My Transition from Student to Full Time Coder](https://github.com/alexroan/blog/blob/master/2016-05-16.transition.md)

Note the original publish date in the name of the md file. If you really want to see (if) what I'm blogging about next (open to suggestions) head over to the dev branch.

Thanks, Alex
