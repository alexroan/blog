# My Transition from Student to Full Time Coder

I started this blog for a few reasons. 

Firstly, I needed somewhere to keep track of all the little projects and ideas that manifest themselves for brief moments before vanishing and never reappearing. 

Secondly, online presence is all the rage nowadays, especially in the tech industry. So building up a public portfolio can only be a good thing (I hope). 

And finally, I wanted to document my path from university into the big bad working world so that budding tech geeks like myself who are studying, or just about to graduate, have a sense of what might be ahead. Moreover, what to look out for and what to avoid along the way. 

Everyone knows of the fabled awkward genius who dropped out of university to move to Silicon Valley and found what would eventually become a Microsoft or Facebook. For me, the thought of dropping out of university never once entered my mind. I studied for as long as I could, in a far flung town in the middle of nowhere, until I eventually gained my degree and moved to Cardiff to pursue my career. Not exactly a fairy tale, but most stories aren't. That doesn't mean to say I'm unhappy, quite the opposite in fact!

### The Move

In early 2015 I was nearing the end of my time in university. I had only one semester of modules left, Tarannau ('Thunder' in Welsh, the name of the university's American Football team which I was playing for) had just gone 6-0 for the first time since the 90's, and my attention was starting to turn towards what would happen when the fun ended and the time came [to 'adult'](http://www.hercampus.com/sites/default/files/2016/02/16/u6ldkinj7mmzzqv9ixvw.jpg).

I started jumping through all of the hoops required to get my name out into the 'recruitosphere': updating Linkedin and my CV, responding to recruiters in my inbox (those blanket emails sent to everyone they could find with 'computer' in their bio), and actively searching through job sites for roles that interested me.

It was pretty terrifying, but exciting at the same time. 

#### Interviewing

After a couple of phone interviews I had eventually bagged myself two formal interviews, the first of which was at a digital marketing agency in Cardiff Bay in the role as Web Developer. Web development was and is not exactly my forte. I had covered a large amount of it at university, but always enjoyed more heavy duty, back-end, application development and problem solving over the fiddly design aspect of Web. Nevertheless, I went in with my chin up and actually got offered the job almost immediately. 

Hedging my bets, I stalled my response until after my second interview, which was for a role of Software Developer at a data restoration company just north of Cardiff. This job required a bit more effort and seemed a bit more difficult to achieve. Part of the interview process was a programming problem for which I was given a few days to solve, and actually rather enjoyed.

Fortunately, these guys also offered me a job. 

At this point I was kind of stuck. What didn't help was that upon finding out I had another offer, the digital marketing company offered to take me out for a lunchtime drink in one of the many bars in Cardiff Bay. Very persuasive. I guess that's why they're in the marketing business.

So, on the one hand was this fun, young company with a young crowd of people enjoying the Cardiff Bay lifestyle. On the other hand was this more serious role. They hadn't tried to woo me in, or schmooze me but I had to do a lot of work just to get the offer. So my social side was leaning one way, and my analytical side was firmly leaning the other. 

My piece of advice for anyone in this situation is to take your time. Don't rush. One day I was siding with one offer, the next I'd be swayed the other way. What you need to think about is the work you'll actually be doing. The 'fun' company provided a nice environment but would I enjoy the actual work? Or would I be counting down the minutes every day until lunch time or home time when I could go to the nearest pub. Would this aid my career progression? On the other hand, how would I know if I would enjoy the work in the 'less fun' (simplified for arguments sake. Turns out it is a lot more fun than not) company and regret not taking the 'fun' job?

The main argument that swayed me was this: which job was the best step to take, knowing it was the first in my professional career? In other words, which step was the highest? My brain knew the answer but my gut wanted beer at lunch. I went with reason, and I am so glad I did.

### To Sum It Up

I'm now just about a year into my role and I've taken ownership of, and contributed to, some very cool in-house projects. 

If you're someone who is currently going through this sort of process, go in with an open mind. Something which I haven't yet mentioned is the expectation I had of what I'm 'worth' coming out of uni. I probably underestimated my value, but it worked in my favour. So don't get hung up on salaries straight out of uni. In fact, you should convince your prospective employers that money is not an issue immediately, experience is far more important in the early years. Aim high but don't demand much. Your work will do the talking and will provide you with all the bargaining power you need. 

Make sure you enjoy your life. For people like me, who love problems and puzzles, the tech industry is such a great place. Find a role that you know will keep you stimulated.
