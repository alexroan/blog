# How I Learned To Program

I'm writing this autobiographical piece after reading Tavish Armstrong's [bio](https://github.com/tarmstrong/longcv/blob/master/bio.md). I find it interesting to understand how other people in the same industry and profession as myself came to acquire the skills they have, and how they compare themselves to others in the field. 

##Early years & Primary School 1992-2003

I was born in 1992. I didn't have a large amount of exposure to computers as a child. In primary school up until the age of eleven I hadn't really used a computer more than to play minesweeper on windows ninety-something. Our house didn't have a steady broadband internet connection until I was well into my teens.

During the latter stages of primary school (or it could have been early secondary school, I'm not quite sure;) I remember going to a local mobile network shop where my dad was getting his first mobile phone, a Nokia 3310 (obviously). This was a big deal for us, we weren't a very technology savvy family. I remember him going back to the shop a few days after complaining that he kept pocked dailing people, to which the shop assistant told him to lock the screen with the middle button followed by the asterisk. Minds blown.

##Secondary 2003-2008

In secondary school I got my first real taste of using computers in IT lessons. In year 7 (the first year of secondary school in Wales) It was all about the basic stuff: Word processers, Publisher, Power Point presentations and very basic Excel.

Throughout this time, the two subjects I enjoyed the most were Maths and Physics. When it came to these, I just seemed to 'get it'. In retrospect, it was probably because I actually wanted to 'get it' that made me pick it up quickly. When in comparison to more subjective areas like Art or English, I just didn't enjoy the way in which a lot of the 'right' answers could just be someone's interpretation of it. A painting could never show me how something works, or why the sky is blue. But describing how it was intended to make you feel a certain way was somehow the right answer.

We upgraded our home PC mid way through secondary school, enabling me to play games like The Sims and Sim City. Still, I had no idea what a command line was, nor how to find it at this point. As the years went by delving deeper into GCSE level Maths and Science, I started to want something a bit more challenging, something more 'programmy'.

##Sixth Form 2008-2010

In Sixth Form, I had the opportunity to take up A Level Computing. Unlike IT, which taught more administrative and research skills, Computing was my first chance to learn some real programming, something which I always wanted to get into but never had the resources (or even someone to point me in the right direction) to pursue. I just never knew where to start.

The first year began with computing 101. Binary, disaster strategies like backing up to different types of media, and basic programming concepts of variables, loops and conditionals. Other than hand writing pseudo-code in class, I don't recall ever really programming anything in the first year of A Level Computing, which sounds completely bizarre to me now.

In the second year however, we were introduced to an application called [Delphi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_(programming_language)). Delphi is an SDK and language which closely resembles Pascal, and provided a drag-and-drop approach to programming. Create a new form, drag a button onto the form and double click the button to navigate to the code behind, where you could program in the button's functionality, much like Visual Studio provides with windows forms. I remember this feeling great, I could finally write code which told the computer step by step instructions. It felt powerful. 

From what I can recall, our main A Level assignment was to create a stock management system for a retailer, and I absolutely loved it. Unlike most seventeen and eighteen year olds, I was actually excited to start working on a piece of coursework. I started immediately and finished it within a few days with some overtime in the IT suite at lunch times. It felt like all of the mathematical and problem solving skills I had been interested in and developed in other subjects finally had a purpose. I should probably point out that I didn't enjoy the write up or exam afterwards...
