# Making Old Private Projects Public

## Dusting Off Old Code

Shortly after graduating in 2015 I lost my student account status in Github. Student credentials allowed 5 free private repos, which I used for crappy side projects (which usually were promptly deleted weeks after creating) and larger university projects I was working on which I was too embarrased about to release publicly. After losing the student creds, these private repos became inaccessible unless I purchased a payment plan (definitely not gunna happen) or made them public. I decided to do neither since these projects were old crap that I wrote whilst I was still learning how to 'computer' in University.

Recently I've been experimenting with PHP and LAMP stuff in my spare time and seemed to be starting from scratch when I knew I had built up a large reference base (however shoddy) in an old project I had done in university. However, it was locked up in these private repos that I had been hiding from the world due to how I felt about them. I didn't want them to be public because I knew they weren't super duper perfect and anyone could pick holes in them, but I did want access to them.

Since working as a developer professionally with other developers, picking holes in eachother's code is a daily occurance. It's something that's vital to being able to learn and improve effectively.

So, after several years of hiding a crappy project under the Github rug I've finally made them public. If nothing else, it fills up my GitHub page a little more.

## The Projects

So the projects I've made public relate to my Major Project from 3rd year. I had proposed the idea of a carpooling service much like [BlaBlaCar](https://www.blablacar.co.uk/) called HitchARide. You post up journeys you're travelling in a few days and other users can ask to hitch a ride with you. The code is all based [here](https://github.com/alexroan/major_project) and the writup (all 10,000+ words of it (yawn)) is [here](https://github.com/alexroan/MajorProjectDocs) . 

Please don't look (but be nice if you do). 

Thanks,
Alex

## EDIT: 2016-11-01 More!

I decided to look through my OneDrive and DropBox accounts where I used to store a lot of my projects. I found a second year project (going back to 2012) called [Concordance](https://github.com/alexroan/concordance) which finds and indexes words in books, written in Java.

## EDIT: 2016-11-03 Even more!

Doing a little more digging I found a gem of a project I wrote in my second year (2012). It contains 3 mini projects, each written in a different language (Java, C++ and C), working together. Check it out at [Shipmanaging](https://github.com/alexroan/shipmanaging). I remember doing this project years ago but didn't think it was any good. I showed some of the code to a friend today who is primarily a C++ developer and he seemed surprised at how good the code was. Looking at it now I can barely make any sense out of it, mainly because I haven't used C or C++ since! 

Two things I can take away from regurgetating old projects like this are:

* I'm more multilingual when it comes to programming than I give myself credit for
* ~5am is the best time to code:

## EDIT: 2016-11-06 Yet more... on rails.

Now I'm really airing out the cobbwebs. I remember doing a module in 3rd year, shortly after finishing my industrial year, which was based on Ruby on Rails. This was not a project I hugely enjoyed or was very proud of. I've named it [UniRuby](https://github.com/alexroan/uniruby). The Ruby on Rails section of the assignment was to expose an API with a backend which enabled users to take out car insurance. The other part was to create a client which would utilise the API (I chose to create a basic HTML AJAX site).

I never imagined I would release this particular project into the public domain, but now that the flood gates are open releasing projects like this is a lot less painful. I'm glad because it could become a fairly good source of reference code in the future, whereas if I had kept it hidden away on some cloud storage somewhere like a digital relic or heirloom, I would never really benefit from the work I put into it. And what's the point in paying for a university degree if you don't take the lessons you learnt away from it?
